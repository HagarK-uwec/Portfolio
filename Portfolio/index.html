            <div>
                <p>My name is Kyle Hagar, I am a senior at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I like to play video games, draw pictures, and watch videos in my free time. I have been lucky to travel to many locations in the United States as well as several countries in Europe and Asia. Traveling has always been a big part of my life seeing many famous locations and getting to see them in person. My love for drawing comes from with a preference of imagery which gets my attentio, and the same thing goes with video games and watching movies. I have never been a big reader and have always struggled to keep my attention while reading articles or books.</p>
